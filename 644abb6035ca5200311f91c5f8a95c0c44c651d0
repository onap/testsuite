      "message": "I\u0027m trying to understand if this might fail in case undeployment takes a long time. The calls for undeploy and delete are consecutive without any breaks. There might be a situation where you get a 202 Accepted but the undeployment is still processing in the background. In the meanwhile you run the delete request, it\u0027s gonna give you a 406 error. Have you faced this situation intermittently while testing this?\n\nAlso I see your undeploy policy request is running a DELETE call and not POST.",
